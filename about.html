    <h2>About Us</h2>
    <p>
        Next-Breath began with a simple idea: that every teen deserves a fresh start.  
        We’ve seen friends fight through vaping and other addictions, and we wanted a space that was real — no lectures, no judgment.  
    </p>
    <p>
        This is more than an organization. It’s a community built by students, for students.  
        We’re here to listen, to walk with you through the hard parts, and to remind you that you are never alone.
